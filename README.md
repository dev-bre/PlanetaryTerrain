# Planetary Terrain

Planetary Terrain is a Unity Asset for spherical terrain with dynamic quadtree-based LOD. With it, you can make the entirety of Earth your game map, to scale!

The bulk of this code was written 2017-2018, and sold on the Unity Asset Store until 2023. Because the asset is no longer maintained, I have decided to open source it.
